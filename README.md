# QueBlock - Blockchain Powered Voting System

QueBlock is a decentralized voting system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages the power of smart contracts written in Solidity to ensure secure and transparent voting processes. This project is implemented using React with TypeScript for the frontend and Ganache Truffle Suite for local development and testing.

## Features

- **Decentralized:** Eliminates the need for central authorities, ensuring trustless and transparent voting.
- **Security:** Utilizes Ethereum's robust blockchain technology to prevent tampering and ensure the integrity of the voting process.
- **Transparency:** Provides a publicly accessible ledger of all voting transactions, enabling auditing and accountability.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Offers an intuitive and responsive user interface built with React and TypeScript for a seamless voting experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with QueBlock, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/QueBlock.git
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:

   \`\`\`bash
   cd QueBlock
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Start the development server:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm start
   \`\`\`

4. Connect to Ganache:

   - Ensure Ganache is running on your local machine.
   - Update the \`truffle-config.js\` file to connect to your Ganache instance.

5. Deploy smart contracts:

   \`\`\`bash
   truffle migrate --reset
   \`\`\`

6. Interact with the application:

   Open your web browser and navigate to \`http://localhost:3000\` to access the QueBlock voting system.

## Smart Contracts

The smart contracts for QueBlock are written in Solidity and are located in the \`contracts/\` directory. These contracts define the logic for creating, voting on, and tallying votes in the decentralized voting system.
